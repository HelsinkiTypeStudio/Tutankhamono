![Tutankhamono specimen](https://github.com/HelsinkiTypeStudio/Tutankhamono/blob/main/documentation/tutankhamono.png)

Tutankhamono carries forth the whispers of long-buried kings into the realm of the living.  
Each glyph is a step toward eternal power, a key to unlocking hidden chambers.  
Summon the people of the underworld as you give shape to their story.
